# SimpleEncryption
A simple encryption and decryption program with it's own algorithm, written in Java

# Example
In order to create an Instance of the `SimpleEncryption` class, you'd have to use the static method `openInstance()`
```java
final SimpleEncryption simpleEncryption = SimpleEncryption.openInstance();
```
---
You can encrypt a string using the `encryptString(String)` method
```java
simpleEncryption.encryptString("Hello, World!");
```
---
You can also decrypt a string using the `decryptString(String)` method
```java
simpleEncryption.decryptString("SOME ENCRYPTED STRING");
```
